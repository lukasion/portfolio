# Portfolio Project with Laravel, Nuxt 3, and SSR Rendering

Welcome to my portfolio project! This web application showcases my skills and projects in a clean and efficient manner. The project is built using a powerful stack including Laravel, Nuxt 3, and SSR rendering for optimal performance. Additionally, I've utilized technologies such as Tailwind CSS, SCSS, Pinia, and MySQL to enhance the overall development experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: A robust PHP framework that provides a solid foundation for building web applications. It follows the MVC pattern and offers features like Eloquent ORM, routing, and more.

- **Nuxt 3**: A progressive JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. Nuxt 3 introduces Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to enhance performance and SEO capabilities.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to design responsive and visually appealing interfaces without the need for custom CSS.

- **SCSS**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. SCSS allows for the use of variables, nesting, and other features to improve the maintainability of stylesheets.

- **Pinia**: A state management library for Vue.js and Nuxt applications. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage the state of your application.

- **MySQL**: A popular open-source relational database management system. It is used to store and retrieve data efficiently for the portfolio project.
